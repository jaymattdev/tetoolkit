# This should point to your SharePoint document library root
# Example: "https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/HR/Documents/Extractions/"

# Hyperlink display style in Excel reports:
#   "full"      - Shows the complete URL in the cell (e.g., "https://sharepoint.com/doc.pdf")
#   "short"     - Shows "Open File" as clickable text (cleaner look, smaller file size)

# File extension for output document links (e.g., if originals are PDFs)
# Set to "" to keep original extensions

# Jaro-Winkler similarity threshold for spell-checking keywords (0.0 - 1.0)
# Higher = more strict (fewer corrections), Lower = more lenient (more corrections)
# Recommended range: 0.80 - 0.95

[Validation]
# Z-score threshold for positional outlier detection
# Higher = less strict (flags fewer outliers)
# Recommended range: 2.5 - 4.0

# Larger = more tolerant of gaps in document structure
